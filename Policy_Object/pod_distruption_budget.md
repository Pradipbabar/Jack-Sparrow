**PodDisruptionBudget (PDB)** in Kubernetes helps maintain application availability during node maintenance, updates, or other disruptive events by defining how many pods of a specific application can be concurrently disrupted. This prevents excessive downtime and ensures that a certain number of pods remain available.

Here's a brief explanation with an example:

**Example: PodDisruptionBudget**

Let's say you have a deployment running three replicas of an application. You want to ensure that at least two replicas are always available even when nodes are being drained for maintenance.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

In this example:
- The `minAvailable` field specifies that at least two pods (replicas) of the application must be available during disruptions.
- The `selector` specifies which pods the PDB applies to based on their labels. In this case, it applies to pods with the label `app: my-app`.

When a node needs to be drained for maintenance, the PodDisruptionBudget ensures that no more than one pod is disrupted at a time. This prevents the application from becoming unavailable due to excessive pod disruptions.

It's important to note that while PodDisruptionBudget helps maintain availability during planned disruptions, it doesn't prevent disruptions caused by unplanned events like node failures.

PodDisruptionBudgets provide a controlled way to manage the impact of maintenance activities on your applications, ensuring that the desired level of availability is maintained even when nodes need to be taken offline.
