# StatefulSets
**StatefulSets** in Kubernetes are used to manage stateful applications, which require stable and unique network identities, stable storage, and ordered deployment and scaling. StatefulSets provide these capabilities while ensuring that pods are created and scaled in a predictable manner.

Here's a brief explanation with an example:

**Example: StatefulSet for a Stateful Application**

Let's consider a stateful application like a database that requires stable network identities, storage, and ordered scaling.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: my-stateful-app
spec:
  serviceName: my-stateful-service
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-stateful-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-stateful-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        volumeMounts:
        - name: data-volume
          mountPath: /data
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: data-volume
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: standard
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

In this example:
- The `StatefulSet` named `my-stateful-app` manages the stateful application.
- The `serviceName` specifies the headless service that provides stable network identities for each pod.
- The `replicas` field sets the desired number of replicas (pods).
- The `template` defines the pod template with labels and containers.
- A `volumeClaimTemplate` is used to define a persistent volume claim for each pod. This ensures stable storage.

When scaling the StatefulSet, new pods are created in an ordered manner, and each pod has a unique and predictable hostname, like `my-stateful-app-0`, `my-stateful-app-1`, etc.

StatefulSets are particularly useful for managing databases, distributed systems, and other applications that require stable identities, storage, and scaling behavior.

Keep in mind that StatefulSets have evolved with the introduction of `StatefulSet` and `StatefulSetV1` in different Kubernetes versions. Make sure to use the appropriate version based on your cluster's Kubernetes version.
