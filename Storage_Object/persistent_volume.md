A **PersistentVolume (PV)** in Kubernetes is a storage resource that abstracts underlying storage details and provides a way to manage and consume persistent storage within the cluster. It acts as an independent storage unit that can be dynamically provisioned or pre-allocated, and it's decoupled from the pods that use it.

Here's a brief explanation of PersistentVolumes with an example:

**Example: PersistentVolume**

Suppose you have a Kubernetes cluster and you want to provide a PersistentVolume for your application's data storage needs.

1. Create a PersistentVolume definition:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolume
   metadata:
     name: my-pv
   spec:
     capacity:
       storage: 10Gi
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
     storageClassName: slow
     nfs:
       server: nfs-server.example.com
       path: /path/to/storage
   ```

In this example:
- The PersistentVolume named `my-pv` has a capacity of 10Gi.
- It's set to ReadWriteOnce access mode, meaning it can be mounted by one node at a time.
- The `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` determines what happens to the PV when released. `Retain` means the PV data is preserved.
- `storageClassName` associates the PV with a StorageClass for dynamic provisioning (optional).
- The PV is backed by an NFS server.

2. After creating the PersistentVolume, it's available in the cluster for use.

3. A user can then request the PV using a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: my-pvc
   spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 5Gi
     storageClassName: slow
   ```

4. Kubernetes binds the PVC to an available PV based on matching criteria like storage class, capacity, and access mode.

5. Use the PVC in a pod's configuration to mount the persistent storage:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: my-app
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: app-container
       image: my-app-image
       volumeMounts:
       - name: data-volume
         mountPath: /data
     volumes:
     - name: data-volume
       persistentVolumeClaim:
         claimName: my-pvc
   ```

This example demonstrates how PersistentVolumes provide a way to abstract storage details and manage persistent storage resources in Kubernetes. PVs can be dynamically provisioned or statically defined, and they enable separation of concerns between storage and application configuration.
