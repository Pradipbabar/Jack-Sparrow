**NodePort** is a type of Kubernetes service that exposes a service on a static port on each node's IP address. This allows external traffic to reach the service by targeting any node's IP along with the specified NodePort. The request is then forwarded to the appropriate pods. NodePort services provide a simple way to expose services externally without relying on external load balancers.

Here's a brief explanation of NodePort with an example:

**Example: NodePort Service**

Imagine you have a web application that consists of multiple pods and you want to expose it externally on a specific port. You can use a NodePort service to achieve this.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: web-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: NodePort
```

In this example:
- The service named `web-service` exposes pods labeled with `app: web-app`.
- It listens on port 80 and forwards traffic to the pods' port 8080.
- The `type` is set to `NodePort`, indicating that it's a NodePort service.

After creating this NodePort service, each node in your cluster will open the specified NodePort (e.g., 30000-32767) to route incoming traffic to the pods associated with the service. External users can then access the application by targeting any node's IP address and the NodePort number.

For instance, if you're using a NodePort of 30080, users can access the application using `http://<node-ip>:30080`.

NodePort services are often used when you want to expose applications externally without using a cloud provider's load balancer or when you're testing and developing on a local or non-cloud environment.
