**ClusterIP** is a type of Kubernetes service that exposes a set of pods within the cluster. It assigns a stable IP address to the service, which is only accessible from within the cluster. This type of service is primarily used for intra-cluster communication, allowing different components within the cluster to access the service without exposing it to the external world.

Here's a brief explanation of ClusterIP with an example:

**Example: ClusterIP Service**

Suppose you have a microservices-based application with a frontend service and a backend service. You want the frontend service to communicate with the backend service, but you don't need external access to the backend service. In this case, you can use a ClusterIP service to provide a stable internal IP address for the backend service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

In this example:
- The service named `backend-service` exposes pods labeled with `app: backend`.
- It listens on port 80 and forwards traffic to the pods' port 8080.
- Since no `type` is specified, the service defaults to `ClusterIP`.

Now, any component within the Kubernetes cluster, such as the frontend service, can communicate with the backend service using the `backend-service` name and the assigned ClusterIP address. However, external traffic from outside the cluster cannot reach this service directly.

ClusterIP services are suitable for scenarios where you need to establish communication between different parts of your application within the cluster. They provide a reliable and stable internal endpoint without exposing it to the public internet.
