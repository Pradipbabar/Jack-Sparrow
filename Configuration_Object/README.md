# Configuration Object

In Kubernetes, configuration objects are essential components that allow you to manage and customize various aspects of your applications and clusters. This Markdown file aims to provide an explanation of several important configuration objects: Resource Quota, ConfigMap, LimitRange, and Secrets.

## [Resource Quota](resource_quota.md)
A Resource Quota is a Kubernetes configuration object used to limit and control the compute resources (CPU and memory) consumed by a set of resources within a namespace. This ensures that a namespace doesn't exceed its allocated resources, preventing resource contention and unexpected resource consumption. Resource Quotas provide isolation and resource management at the namespace level.

### Key aspects of a Resource Quota include:

- Limits: Define maximum resource consumption for pods, services, replication controllers, and more within a namespace.
- Requests: Set minimum resource requirements that pods must satisfy.
- Scopes: Resource Quotas can be set for a particular namespace, ensuring that its resources remain within defined limits.
- Usage Monitoring: Resource Quotas track resource consumption and provide usage information for monitoring and analysis.

## [ConfigMap](configmap.md)
A ConfigMap is a Kubernetes configuration object used to store configuration data in key-value pairs. It decouples configuration details from application code, making it easier to manage and modify configuration without altering the application itself. ConfigMaps are often used to store environment variables, configuration files, and other settings.

### Key aspects of a ConfigMap include:

- Data Storage: ConfigMaps store data in key-value pairs.
- Immutability: Once created, ConfigMaps are generally considered immutable; changes require creating a new ConfigMap.
- Pod Consumption: ConfigMaps can be consumed by pods as environment variables or mounted as volumes.
- Namespacing: ConfigMaps can be specific to a namespace or shared across namespaces.
- Updating ConfigMaps: Pods can detect changes in ConfigMaps and automatically update themselves accordingly.

## [LimitRange](limit_range.md)

A LimitRange is a Kubernetes configuration object used to enforce resource constraints within a namespace. Unlike Resource Quotas, which focus on compute resources, LimitRanges restrict a variety of resource-related parameters, including the number of objects (e.g., pods, services) in a namespace, pod runtime properties, and storage requests.

### Key aspects of a LimitRange include:

- Resource Limits: Define limits for CPU, memory, and storage at the pod level.
- Object Limits: Control the number of pods, services, and other objects within a namespace.
- Default Settings: Establish default values for resource requests and limits when they are not explicitly defined in pod specifications.
- Pod Properties: Enforce constraints on pod properties like CPU shares, memory requests, and storage requests.
- Namespace Scope: LimitRanges are applied to specific namespaces and ensure that resources within them adhere to the defined constraints.

## [Secrets](secrets.md)

Secrets are Kubernetes configuration objects used to store sensitive information, such as authentication credentials, API tokens, and other confidential data. Secrets provide a way to manage sensitive information securely, ensuring it's not exposed in plain text within the cluster or configuration files.

### Key aspects of Secrets include:

- Data Types: Secrets can store binary data or string data, typically in the form of key-value pairs.
- Encoding: Data in Secrets can be encoded to base64 for storage, but it's important to note that this is not encryption.
- Pod Consumption: Secrets can be consumed by pods as environment variables, mounted volumes, or used as image pull credentials.
- Security: Secrets are stored securely within the Kubernetes etcd database and are only accessible to authorized users.
- Updating Secrets: Secrets can be updated, and the changes automatically propagate to pods that consume them.
