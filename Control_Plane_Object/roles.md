1. **Role:**
   A **Role** is a Kubernetes object that defines a set of permissions within a specific namespace. It grants access to a specific set of resources and operations (such as create, read, update, delete) within that namespace. Roles are used to control what actions users, groups, or service accounts can perform on resources in a particular namespace.

   Example:
   You might create a Role named "read-pods" in the "default" namespace that grants read-only access to pods within that namespace. This Role could allow users to list and view pod information but not modify or delete them.

2. **ClusterRole:**
   A **ClusterRole** is similar to a Role, but it applies cluster-wide across all namespaces. It defines a set of permissions that can be applied to resources in any namespace within the cluster. ClusterRoles are used to grant access to resources and actions that are not namespace-specific.

   Example:
   You might create a ClusterRole named "admin" that grants full access to cluster-wide resources like nodes, namespaces, and persistent volumes. This ClusterRole could be used to give administrative privileges across the entire cluster.

3. **RoleBinding:**
   A **RoleBinding** is a Kubernetes object that associates a Role (or ClusterRole) with a user, group, or service account within a specific namespace. It allows you to grant the defined permissions to a specific entity. The entity specified in the RoleBinding is granted the permissions defined in the associated Role or ClusterRole.

   Example:
   You might create a RoleBinding named "read-pods-binding" in the "default" namespace that binds the "read-pods" Role to the user "alice." This allows Alice to read pods within the "default" namespace.

4. **ClusterRoleBinding:**
   A **ClusterRoleBinding** is similar to a RoleBinding, but it associates a ClusterRole with a user, group, or service account across all namespaces in the cluster. It grants permissions at the cluster level, affecting resources and actions across the entire cluster.

   Example:
   You might create a ClusterRoleBinding named "admin-binding" that binds the "admin" ClusterRole to the user "admin-user." This gives the "admin-user" administrative privileges across all namespaces in the cluster.
