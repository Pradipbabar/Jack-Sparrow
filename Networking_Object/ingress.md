**Ingress** is a Kubernetes resource that manages external access to services within a cluster. It acts as a layer 7 load balancer, directing incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic to different services based on rules defined in the Ingress resource. Ingress provides features like SSL termination, virtual hosting, and path-based routing.

Here's a brief explanation of Ingress with an example:

Let's say you have multiple services in your Kubernetes cluster, and you want to expose them to the external world using different domain names and paths. Ingress allows you to achieve this.

1. **Create an Ingress:**

   Suppose you have two services: `frontend-service` and `backend-service`, and you want to expose them using two different subdomains: `frontend.example.com` and `backend.example.com`.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: my-ingress
     annotations:
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
   spec:
     rules:
     - host: frontend.example.com
       http:
         paths:
         - path: /
           pathType: Prefix
           backend:
             service:
               name: frontend-service
               port:
                 number: 80
     - host: backend.example.com
       http:
         paths:
         - path: /
           pathType: Prefix
           backend:
             service:
               name: backend-service
               port:
                 number: 80
   ```

   In this example, the Ingress named `my-ingress` defines two rules, one for each subdomain. Each rule routes traffic to a specific service based on the requested path.

2. **Applying the Ingress:**

   When you apply the Ingress resource, it creates an external-facing load balancer that routes incoming requests to the appropriate services based on the defined rules.

3. **Access the Services:**

   Once the Ingress is configured and propagated, users can access your services using the specified subdomains and paths:
   - Requests to `http://frontend.example.com/` will be directed to the `frontend-service`.
   - Requests to `http://backend.example.com/` will be directed to the `backend-service`.

4. **Annotations and Controllers:**

   In the example, the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /` is used to rewrite the URL path when routing requests. Different Ingress controllers may support various annotations to configure behaviors like SSL termination, load balancing algorithms, and more.

Ingress provides a convenient and flexible way to manage external access to your services, avoiding the need to expose each service directly. Keep in mind that Ingress functionality requires an Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx Ingress Controller or Traefik) to be installed in your cluster.
